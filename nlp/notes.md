# Notes on Natural Language Processing

- Terminology

## Terms

- **Morpheme** - the smallest meaningful unit of a given language.
- **Root** - the root of a word without any affixes attached.
- **Stem** - an word with an affix attached.
- **Affix** - one of either prefix, suffix, infix, or circumfix
- **Word** - the single smallest element of a sentence that carries meaning

All words are morphemes, but not all morphemes are words. Words can stand on
their own.

Morphemes that stand on their own are called roots.

Roots and words are similar, but the important distinction is that words can
have affixes, but roots cannot.
