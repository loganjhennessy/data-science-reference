# Linear Transformation

# Eigen Vectors

What is an Eigen Vector?

I asked Matt if he could explain what they are, and he correctly picked
up on that I was asking for an intuitive definition for what an Eigen
Vector is. But, he said that he can't really give me what I want.

He said that his understanding of Eigen Vectors are grounded in an
understanding of Linear Transformations. So, if you want to understand
Eigen Vectors, start by understanding Linear Transformations.

# Power Iteration

This is an algorithm that allows us to compute the maximum Eigen Vector
for a given matrix. It is a fairly straightforward algorithm, which is
why using the max Eigen Vector is common.
